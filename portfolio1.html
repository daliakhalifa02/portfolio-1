  <img width="500px" height="300px" src="images/img1.jpg" />
  <p>Started photography at the age of 17.<br />
    It was a self-taught talent, until I took a course few years later to level it up into professional
    photosessions.<br />
    Photography is my passion ever since I was a little kid. It's the absolute way to keep a memory forever!</p>
